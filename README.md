Housing Pricing Dataset Analysis
This repository contains code to analyze a housing pricing dataset using Random Forest and Decision Tree models in Python.

Dataset
The dataset contains features related to housing properties and their corresponding prices. 

Loads the dataset using pandas.
Preprocesses the data (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables if any).
Splits the data into training and testing sets.
Trains Random Forest and Decision Tree models on the training data.
Evaluates the models' performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
